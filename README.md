# Card Monkey

![Card Monkey](https://github.com/doombubbles/card-monkey/blob/main/CardMonkey-Icon.png?raw=true)

This is the Pre-Release of the Card Monkey mod, meant to serve also as an example and template for creating a fully featured (15 upgrades, all crosspaths, custom displays) tower using BTD Mod Helper.

It is currently in a very playable state, and the actual coding aspect is basically finished.

Completed:
* All 15 Upgrade Implementations (+ Crosspathing)
* All Upgrade Icons
* Some Portrait textures
* Some custom/modified Display Models

Yet to Come:
* Flesh out the Display Models for Tier 3-4 crosspaths, and touch up the Tier 1 - 2 crosspaths
* Make the different Upgrade Portrait artwork
* More balancing on the costs and strengths of the upgrades

**Changelog**

v0.1.1 Fix Display Models

v0.1.0 Pre Release
